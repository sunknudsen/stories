<span class="drop-cap">B</span>ack in 2015 we were in a digital marketing gold rush. Tech marketers were the new “unicorns” and everyone wanted a piece of the action (including myself).

At the time, I was learning as much as I could about digital marketing and noticed a gap in the market. Marketers were using Bitly (and the like) to track multi-channel campaigns and spreadsheets to aggregate stats from which marketing insights were derived.

**The process was painstakingly inefficient** yet some of the pain could be avoided so I got to work on what became Lickstats.

Thanks to the help of many (**Annie-Claude Devriese**, **Claudia Loutfi**, **Ilias Benjelloun**, **Louis-Félix Binette** and **Tara Hunt** to name a few), Lickstats gained momentum.

Together, we got Lickstats in the hands of amazing brands such as [C2 Montréal](https://www.c2montreal.com/#/), [Moment Factory](https://www.loreal.com/en/) and [L’oréal](https://www.loreal.com/en/) tracking millions of clicks originating from all over the world.

Fast-forward a few years and the digital marketing landscape has changed a lot… **so have I.**

Initially, I was excited to develop technologies to track people.

**Now, I am a [privacy and security researcher](/) and [privacy advocate](https://www.youtube.com/sunknudsen).**

This change in values was incorporated into Lickstats which became a privacy-conscious analytics platform, but let’s face it… most marketers are not privacy advocates (much the opposite, perhaps unconsciously).

The Lickstats product-market fit isn’t solid enough and revenue as been steadily declining.

More importantly, **I no longer use Lickstats myself**.

It’s time to move on.

## How things are going to unfold
