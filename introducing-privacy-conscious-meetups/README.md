<span class="drop-cap">F</span>irst things first, privacy guides meetups have been renamed to **privacy-conscious meetups** (more on this announced shortly).

Now that name change is out of the way, according to [this](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxRQ9m4G2c5-JuM6XOzgYgacLwI52lC0xW) poll, getting together on Saturday afternoon is best.

Happy to announce that first privacy-conscious meetup will happen on **December 4th 2021 at 1PM EST** (Montreal-time).

Rendezvous point is [https://meet.sunknudsen.com/privacy-conscious-meetup](https://meet.sunknudsen.com/privacy-conscious-meetup) (proudly [self-hosted](/privacy-guides/how-to-self-host-hardened-jitsi-server) at [Njalla](https://njal.la/) in Sweden).

In a perfect world, we would get together IRL but, first, we’re all over the world and, second, COVID (that said, can’t wait to meet you guys in person one day).

Looking forward to seeing you (or not, webcam is optional) shortly.

In the meantime, here’s how you can get ready.

- Download and install [Jitsi Meet Electron](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron)
- Prepare a beverage of your liking
- Prepare any questions you have

Please keep an eye on [https://sunknudsen.com/meetups](https://sunknudsen.com/meetups) (this page) for updates.

**Pumped!**
