<span class="drop-cap">I</span>f you are reading this story, you are likely one of my PeerTube viewers which means you care about **decentralization** and **privacy** which is heartwarming (thanks for caring). ðŸ¤—

I was hoping the [privacy guides](/privacy-guides) project could become a full-time jobâ€¦ which is another great example of my entrepreneurial reality distortion field (especially given I declined a dozen sponsorships and have [disabled monetization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6YmdRryKZU) on YouTube).

**The journey has been amazing so far!** YouTube has changed my life for the better, but I canâ€™t say as much about PeerTube. I have been struggling with [issues](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/issues?q=author%3Asunknudsen) that distract me from content creation (which on its own is more overwhelming that one would think).

Hosting video is not an easy endeavor. The [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) project is a beautiful open source achievement and its developers are talented and tenacious. ðŸ™Œ

I recently joined the security team at [TrustToken](https://www.trusttoken.com/). So far, Iâ€™m having a blast! Weâ€™re [hiring](https://www.trusttoken.com/about#careers) btw.

The tradeoff is that time I can allocate to side hustles has compressed significantly.

As a result, I decided to shutdown my PeerTube instance to simplify my creative process.

Want to know when I publish on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/sunknudsen) and view content on [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) or over [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)? Please consider subscribing to my [RSS feed](https://sunknudsen.com/feeds/vlog.xml).

Thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas on PeerTube.

Love,

Sun
